ðŸŽ¯ COMPLETE SOLUTION - ALL PROBLEMS FIXED
===========================================

âœ… 1. FIXED st.experimental_rerun() DEPRECATION
   - Replaced ALL instances of st.experimental_rerun() with st.rerun()
   - Updated throughout app.py in all page transitions

âœ… 2. IMPLEMENTED 10 MAIN + 10 BUFFER QUESTION SYSTEM
   - API generates 20 questions total from full PDF text
   - First 10 questions: Main test set (difficulty 0.3-0.7)
   - Last 10 questions: Buffer set (difficulty 0.1-0.9)
   - User only sees 10 questions maximum
   - Buffer questions used intelligently when main set lacks suitable difficulty match

âœ… 3. ROBUST JSON PARSING & ERROR HANDLING
   - Added clean_json_response() method to fix API response formatting
   - Removes markdown code blocks automatically
   - Fixes common JSON errors (trailing commas, malformed brackets)
   - Retry logic with batch generation (2x10 instead of 1x20)
   - Graceful handling of partial failures

âœ… 4. IMPROVED QUESTION GENERATION STRATEGY
   - Split into 2 API calls: main batch + buffer batch
   - Reduces token limits and JSON truncation issues
   - Rate limiting between calls to avoid API errors
   - Minimum 15 questions required, pads to 20 if needed

âœ… 5. ENHANCED ADAPTIVE TEST ENGINE
   - Smart question selection: main pool first, buffer as fallback
   - Proper difficulty matching with tolerance ranges
   - Tracks used questions across both pools
   - Maximum 10 questions shown to user (configurable)

âœ… 6. BETTER USER EXPERIENCE
   - Clear feedback after each question with explanations
   - Live metrics update after submission
   - Proper test flow: question â†’ feedback â†’ next question
   - Clean session state management
   - Improved error messages and status indicators

âœ… 7. FULL PDF TEXT PROCESSING
   - Sends entire extracted PDF text to API (no 1000-word limit)
   - Better text cleaning and validation
   - Enhanced error handling for various PDF issues

âœ… 8. PRODUCTION-READY FEATURES
   - Comprehensive error handling throughout
   - Session state cleanup on restart/new upload
   - API status monitoring in sidebar  
   - Professional UI with custom CSS
   - Detailed progress tracking and analytics

KEY ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS:
===============================

ðŸ”§ Backend (backend.py):
   - Robust OpenRouterAPI class with batch processing
   - Enhanced AdaptiveTestEngine with buffer support
   - Better error handling and JSON repair mechanisms
   - Smart question pool management

ðŸŽ¨ Frontend (app.py):
   - Fixed all deprecated Streamlit functions
   - Improved user flow with feedback system
   - Better state management
   - Professional styling and user experience

ðŸš€ USAGE:
=========
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Create .env with OR_API_KEY=your_key
3. streamlit run app.py
4. Upload PDF â†’ generates 20 questions â†’ shows 10 in test with smart buffer usage

All your reported issues are now resolved! ðŸŽ‰
